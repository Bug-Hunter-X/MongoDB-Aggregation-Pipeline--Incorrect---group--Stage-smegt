# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Bug: Incorrect `$group` Stage

This repository demonstrates a common error in MongoDB aggregation pipelines involving the `$group` stage. The provided code exhibits an issue in the grouping and sorting of documents, leading to incorrect results.

## Problem Description

The `bug.js` file contains an aggregation pipeline that attempts to group documents by a field named `fieldName`, count the occurrences of each group, sort the groups by count in descending order, and limit the results to the top 10. However, a common error is the misspecification of the `_id` field in the `$group` stage, or an illogical ordering of stages that can lead to unexpected outcomes.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file shows the corrected aggregation pipeline, providing the correct way to specify the `_id` field and ensuring proper data aggregation.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `bug.js` (will show incorrect aggregation).
3. Run `bugSolution.js` (will show corrected aggregation).
4. Review the difference between the two scripts and the comments included for a detailed explanation of the error and the correction.
